A map of all Meshtastic nodes heard via MQTT.

My version of the map is available at http://smpisa.ddn.net:9090

## How does it work?

- An [mqtt client](./src/mqtt.js) is persistently connected to `smpisa.ddn.net` and subscribed to the `msh/#` topic.
- All messages received are attempted to be decoded as [ServiceEnvelope](https://buf.build/meshtastic/protobufs/docs/main:meshtastic#meshtastic.ServiceEnvelope) packets.
- If a packet is encrypted, it attempts to decrypt it with the default `AQ==` key.
- If a packet can't be decoded as a `ServiceEnvelope`, it is ignored.
- `NODEINFO_APP` packets add a node to the database.
- `POSITION_APP` packets update the position of a node in the database.
- `NEIGHBORINFO_APP` packets log neighbours heard by a node to the database.
- `TELEMETRY_APP` packets update battery and voltage metrics for a node in the database.
- `TRACEROUTE_APP` packets log all trace routes performed by a node to the database.
- `MAP_REPORT_APP` packets are stored in the database, but are not widely adopted, so are not used yet.
- The database is a MySQL server, and a nodejs express server is running an API to serve data to the map interface.

## Features

- [x] Connects to mqtt.meshtastic.org to collect nodes and metrics.
- [x] Shows nodes on the map if they have reported a valid position.
- [x] Search bar to find nodes by ID, Hex ID, Short Name and Long Name.
- [x] Hover over nodes on the map to see basic information and a preview image.
- [x] Click nodes on the map to show a sidebar with more info such as telemetry graphs and traceroutes.
- [x] Ability to share a direct link to a node. The map will auto navigate to it.
- [x] Device list. To see which hardware models are most popular.
- [x] Mobile optimised layout.
- [x] Settings available to hide nodes from the map if they haven't been updated in a while.
- [x] Real-Time message UI to view `TEXT_MESSAGE_APP` packets as they come in.
- [x] View position history of a node between a selectable time range.
- [x] "Neighbours" map layer. Shows blue connection lines between nodes that heard the other node.
  - This information is taken from the `NEIGHBORINFO_APP`.
  - Some neighbour lines are clearly wrong.
  - Meshtastic firmware older than [v2.3.2](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/releases/tag/v2.3.2.63df972) reports MQTT nodes as Neighbours.
  - This was fixed in [meshtastic/firmware/#3457](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/3457), but adoption will likely be slow...
